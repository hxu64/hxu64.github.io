Welcome to my project/blog site!

I'm a first-year Computer Science undergrad at the University of Toronto (St. George).

I enjoy writing [competitive programming contests](https://dmoj.ca/user/qt), and also likes spending time immersing in nature.

I plan to write more about my experiences in university, so make sure to check back soon!
